I will uload my exercises from MATLAB
Define the original discrete-time signal.
The 'n' variable is defined as a sequence of values ​​ranging from 0 to 10, and the 'x' variable is defined as the corresponding array of values ​​representing the original discrete-time signal.

Draw the original discrete-time signal.
The "stem" function is used to create a discrete stem plot of the "n" values ​​on the x-axis and the corresponding "x" values ​​on the y-axis. The resulting figure shows the original time-discrete signal.

Define a time offset.
The variable 'k' is defined as 3. It represents the amount by which the discrete-time signal is shifted in time.

Create a time-shifted signal.
The variable 'x_shifted' is defined as part of the 'x' value from the (1+k)th element to the end. This creates a new signal that is the original signal shifted by 'k' time units.

Plot the time-shifted signal.
Use the 'stem' function again to create a discrete stem plot with the 'n' values ​​on the x-axis and the corresponding 'x_shifted' values ​​on the y-axis. The resulting figure shows the time-shifted discrete-time signal.

Define magnification.
The 'a' variable is defined as 2 and represents the scaling factor applied to the discrete-time signal.

Create a scaled signal.
The variable "x_scaled" is defined as the original time-discrete signal "x" multiplied by the scaling factor "a". This creates a new signal that is the original signal scaled by 'a'.

Plot the scaled signal.
Use the 'stem' function again to create a discrete stem plot with the 'n' values ​​on the x-axis and the corresponding 'x_scaled' values ​​on the y-axis. The resulting figure shows the scaled discrete-time signal.

Create an inverse signal.
The x_reversed variable is defined as the x value flipped from left to right using the fliplr function. This creates a new signal that is the inverse of the original discrete-time signal. Draw an inverted signal.
Use the 'stem' function again to create a discrete stem plot with the 'n' values ​​on the x-axis and the corresponding 'x_reversed' values ​​on the y-axis. The resulting plot shows the inverted discrete-time signal.
