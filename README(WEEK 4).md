WEEK 4
Example 1:


Prompt the user to enter a length value and unit using the input function.
Stores the entered length value in variable length and the entered unit in variable units.
Displays the length and units entered using the fprintf function in formatted output.
Example 2:


Generate x-axis sample data using the linspace function to create a vector ranging from 0 to 2*pi at 100 points.
Compute the y-values ​​of the two functions sin(x) and cos(x) using element-wise operations. Create two separate plots using different colors ('r' for red, 'b' for blue) using plotting functions, displaying x on the x-axis and y1 (sin( x)) and y2 (for cos(x)). ) and. on the y-axis or
Add x-axis labels, y-axis labels, and titles to each chart using the xlabel, ylabel, and title functions, respectively.
Create a separate mapping window for each plot using the mapping function.
Example 3:


Use the colon operator to define a range of x values ​​from 0 to 10 in 0.1 increments.
Compute the y-values ​​of the two functions exp(x) and log(x) using element-wise arithmetic. Create a single plot using the plot function with two lines (one for exp(x) and one for log(x)) of different colors ('r' for red, 'b' for blue).
Add a title, x-axis label, and y-axis label to the chart using the title, xlabel, and ylabel functions respectively.
Add a legend to the chart by labeling the two lines using the Legend feature.
Example 4:


Define variables for initial investment amount, annual interest rate, number of years, number of months, and various monthly deposit amounts.
Use nested loops to calculate the investment account value after 10 years for each monthly deposit amount. Display values ​​computed using the fprintf function in formatted output.
