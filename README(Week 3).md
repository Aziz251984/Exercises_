Example 1:

Define the radius: The variable 'radius' is set to 4, representing the radius of a circle.

Compute the area: The variable 'area' is computed by multiplying pi (the mathematical constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter) by the square of the radius using the exponentiation operator '^'. The result is then displayed using the 'disp' function with a label 'area='.

Compute the circumference: The variable 'circum' is computed by multiplying 2*pi (twice the value of pi) by the radius. The result is then displayed using the 'disp' function with a label 'circum='.

Example 2:

Define the time vector: The variable 't' is defined as a time vector ranging from 0 to 0.6 seconds with a step size of 0.02 seconds, resulting in an array of values.

Define the sinusoidal function: The variable 'sin' is set to 10, representing a scalar value.

Compute the function: The variable 'y' is computed by multiplying 'sin' by 3, and then multiplying the result by a sinusoidal function with a frequency of 10pi times 't'. This creates a sinusoidal waveform with an amplitude of 3sin and a frequency of 10*pi times 't'.

Plot the function: The 'plot' function is used to plot 'y' against 't' on a graph. The 'title' function is used to set the title of the graph as 'Practise equation' to provide a visual representation of the plotted sinusoidal waveform.
