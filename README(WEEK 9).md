Of course, the step-by-step instructions for the program are:


1. The program begins by prompting the user for the type of operation to perform (move, scale, or flip) using the MATLAB input() function.

2. Next, the program uses the same input() function to prompt the user for the type of signal (discrete or continuous) on which the operation is to be performed.

3. Next, the program prompts the user to enter a shift amount, scale factor, or inverse value, depending on the type of operation selected in step 1.

4. When the user enters a value, the program checks if the input value is within a certain range of values. If the input value is outside the allowed range, an exception will be thrown and the user will be prompted to enter a realistic value.

Five. If the input value is within range, the program performs the specified operation on the selected signal using MATLAB functions such as fft() for discrete signals and conv() for continuous signals.

6. The program plots the original and transformed signals using the MATLAB plot() function, with appropriate labels on the x- and y-axes and a plot title.

7. Finally, the program displays a message asking the user if he wants to perform another operation. If yes, the program returns to step 1. If no, the program exits.Â
